Todo:

Working on bluetooth...

Fix bug with refresh then back...

Cleanup on sleep...

Break into side effects, handlers, transitions.

Make startup faster (in production).

Add some sort of pre-conditions on state in handlers.

Implement some sort of component should update in views
to prevent reloading ui unneccesarily.

Refactor everything (bluetooth, ui, remote, ...)
